    <p>Thank you for taking the time to do this survey! We expect it to take between 30 min and an hour.</p>
    <p>Below is a link to a youtube video. This video was shown to participants in our study, along with asking them to identify any user needs.</p>
    <p>Please take some time to watch the video 2 times, and feel free to reference the video while doing this survey.</p>
    <p>For your reference, here are the definitions of the terms you will see:</p>
    <p><strong>Is the need impactful?:</strong> The need has the potential to create a real difference. This will delight the user.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it an implicit need?:</strong> This is not a common requirement. Not a general requirement given to the designers.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it obvious?:</strong> In all circumstances, the majority of the users will express this need. If 20 users were interviewed, the majority will share this need</p>
    <p><strong>Is it inefficient?</strong>: This will not have a positive effect on the user experience. Not going to improve the experience with the product, service or system.</p>
