96,quickly store cord after use,Continuous operation for extended periods of time,height of components that user must interact with physically are comfortable,long cord reach/reach from power source if stationary,Wire on the vacuum is difficult to unravel,A place to put the trash that was on the floor
97,Easy to move around;,to be able to clean all locations on the floor without tripping hazards or major obstructions,A more ergonomic vacuum handle/overall design,Restrictive to try to pick up the socks while also vacuuming - the user's body had a hard time navigating around the vacuum to perform the task of picking up the socks;,"Wire on the vacuum is difficult to wrap back up, because it is very long and must bend down to wrap it up",Vacuum is not very secure resting on the edge of the table;
98,Storage for the vacuum,"a cleaner workspace, as the vacuuming could have been simplified much more",Vacuum seems somewhat heavy when picked up to move across obstacles like the wire,to be able to control the movement of the device,The room is very cluttered making it difficult for the user to navigate the space,A way to support or let vacuum free stand without human interaction
99,a place to put lose items that have been collected,cord can be easily secured at its end,large range of motion from given user position (ie user can vacuum large area without moving),to be able to clean the floor while mostly standing,retracting cord reel,storage such as shelves to keep items off the floor
100,to have the device effectively maintain contact with the ground/ have continuous cleaning capabilities while in use,vacuum in corners and along edges,Move potential larger blockages on the floor out of the way,Way to help the user identify dirty parts of the surface,to pick up objects along the way,Flexible vacuum stem so user can vacuum under low desks or gaps with no obstructions
101,"The vacuum itself looks heavy, it may be in their best interests to use a lighter one",Struggled with cable unwrapping,needs the head of the vacuum to be heavier as to not have it shift around so much and stay on the ground;,Confused by dropping the vacuum foot,ergonomic cord storage (ie not uncomfortable to plug in cord or return to storage),a way to store the dirt and mess that they clean away from the floor
102,Wire gets in the way during vacuuming,Struggled to rewrap the cable,"Device robustness to impact, both of the brush head and the pylon",Wire gets in the way during vacuuming,to be able to clean objects off the floor,Multiple cleaning functions
103,Flexible vacuum stem so user can vacuum under low desks or gaps with no obstructions,to pick up objects along the way,easier reach under desks/into harder to reach spaces,Cord organization so user does not have to navigate around cord or pick up cord while using the vacuum,to be able to see the progress of cleaning;,stabilize the vacuum while putting cord away
104,cord does not tangle,Can adjust the product to fit what user intends to do,"a way to be able to move obstructions other than small items on ground (table, boxes)",Seems not too heavy to carry around;,"Vacuum does not turn super easily, user has to drag it in the direction they desire at certain points",Non-marking or damaging to the surface
105,"Storage space for vacuum such that it can be kept in a stable, upright position;",user does not have to bend down during use,Flexible vacuum stem so user can vacuum under low desks or gaps with no obstructions,Clog detection/warning;,a place to put lose items that have been collected,easier chord management system
106,a design that doesn't force her to bend her back as much,Way to help the user identify dirty parts of the surface,ideally will only need to use 1 hand in order to clean the floor,to be able to start cleaning relatively quickly,Cord untangling method after vacuuming and after the cord has traveled along the space with the user,basket attachment to place larger items instead of carrying them by hand
107,A way to use the vacuum without tripping over the cord,easily maeurverable by hand,More efficient way to unwrap and rewrap the cord on the vacuum,Should not get tangled with wires when in use,a way to not step on the wire,Can be stored easily in tight spaces
108,Easy to store,needs someone to help her move the furniture around so she can adequately clean the space,to clean with relatively little bending over.,"The vacuum does not stand on its own, the user has to prop / hold it up while wrapping the wire",Ability to clean multiple surfaces,needs the head of the vacuum to be heavier as to not have it shift around so much and stay on the ground;
